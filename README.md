# Scraping and analysing
>Scraping

In the `Scraping` folder I scrapy the data of the relaischateaux website.

And in the `michelinScraping` folder I scrapy the data of the starred restaurant of michelin.

>Analysing

I store those data as json file, rebuild it to the `dataAnalyse` file.

In the `dataAnalyse.js`, I match all the restaurant with the starred michelin and store it as `afterSort.json`

Also designed a script to express the Price range, store it as `XRegExp`.

# Html for searching restaurant
>Searching

In the front-end folder I design a website for searching the michelin starred restaurant in `castle.html`.

One button for name searching(Using reguler expression), one button for details searching( price and rating ).

Also we can click on the searching result to go to the website of the selected restaurant to get more details.
